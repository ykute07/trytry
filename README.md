## Inspiration
For a long time, I wanted to work on some kind of blockchain application, but I didn't really have the experience or time to make it happen. Then one day I was browsing through Reddit and saw an advertisement for the NEAR Metabuild hackathon and decided to take a look. Sure enough, there was a "Welcome Track" that would be perfect for me to submit to. I'm really glad I decided to join the hackathon because I learned a lot about the blockchain world and NEAR protocol itself!

## Background
![Profile Photo](https://i.imgur.com/XJ4SoZJ.png)

My name is Anthony, I'm an undergraduate studying AI at Stanford University. I came into this project with a little bit of experience building full-stack applications and NO experience with Rust or NEAR protocol. You can often find me on the [NEAR protocol Discord](https://discord.gg/qKFREzxuTZ) in `#dev-support` asking or answering questions!

## Project
My project is a fully decentralized platform for music (like Spotify) where people can listen or post music and artists can earn NEAR from their listeners. 

There are 2 main problems that I try to address with this project:

_1) Artists should have ownership of their music and be able to freely trade their ownership of their music._

_2) Listeners should be able to listen to high-quality music and be able to directly support their favorite artists._

How does my application solve these problems? Artists can **upload their music as an NFT** which gives them ownership of their music which then can be **freely traded on any NFT marketplace.** They can also **attach royalties to their music** so that when ownership of the song is traded between owners, they get a portion of the revenue. The music is also **uploaded as lossless  _.wav_ files thanks to IPFS and Filecoin** providing a safe and easy way to store large files. This allows listeners to have access to the original audio that the artist intended for them to hear. The platform also **supports tipping your favorite artists with NEAR tokens,** so listeners support their favorite artists directly.

## How It's Built

There are two parts to the applications. The frontend was built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to support a faster and easier development workflow.  The backend was obviously built using [NEAR protocol](https://near.org/) and I did not require any 3rd party backend.

For the front-end, I used next-js-api to make RPC calls from my application.

### [/nearsound/context/NearProvider.js](https://github.com/pythonicode/nearsound/blob/main/context/NearProvider.js)
```js
const _tokens = near.connection.provider.query({
   request_type: "call_function",
   finality: "final",
   account_id: "nearsound.testnet",
   method_name: "nft_tokens",
   args_base64: DEFAULT_SEARCH,
});
const _search = near.connection.provider.query({
   request_type: "call_function",
   finality: "final",
   account_id: "nearsound.testnet",
   method_name: "get_search_terms",
   args_base64: EMPTY_QUERY,
});
const _request = near.connection.provider.experimental_genesisConfig();
const [default_tokens, search_terms, response] = await Promise.all([
   _tokens,
   _search,
   _request,
]);
```

There were 5 ways that my application communicated with my smart contract.

1) Fetch data from all tokens minted on the smart contract

2) Fetch data for a certain subset of tokens on the smart contract given a search term

3) Allow users to store an "Artist Name" associated with their account on the smart contract

4) Mint songs as NFTs while supporting the necessary data for the above use cases

5) Log transaction details so minting data can be fetched and displayed in the application

You can find some of the modifications to the smart contract that I made below which intend to address the above situations.

### [/nearsound/near-contracts/nft-contract/artist.rs](https://github.com/pythonicode/nearsound/blob/main/near-contracts/nft-contract/src/artist.rs)

```rust
pub fn create_artist(&mut self, artist_name: Artist) {
        let initial_storage_usage = env::storage_usage();
        let _artist = self.artist_by_account.get(&env::predecessor_account_id());
        if let Some(_artist) = _artist {
            env::panic_str("Artist already exists for this user. You cannot change your Artist Name.");
        } else {
            self.artist_by_account.insert(&env::predecessor_account_id(), &artist_name);
        }
        let required_storage_in_bytes = env::storage_usage() - initial_storage_usage;
        refund_deposit(required_storage_in_bytes);  // Refund any excess storage
}
```

### [/nearsound/near-contracts/nft-contract/internal.rs](https://github.com/pythonicode/nearsound/blob/main/near-contracts/nft-contract/src/internal.rs)

```rust
pub(crate) fn internal_add_token_to_search(&mut self, search_term: &SearchTerm, token_id: &TokenId){
        // Get tokens for a given search term
        let mut tokens_set = self.tokens_per_search.get(search_term).unwrap_or_else(|| {
            UnorderedSet::new(
                StorageKey::TokensPerSearchInner {
                    // Get a new unique prefix for the collection
                    search_term_hash: hash_search_term(&search_term),
                }
                .try_to_vec()
                .unwrap(),
            )
        });
        // Add token to set with search term
        tokens_set.insert(token_id);
        self.tokens_per_search.insert(search_term, &tokens_set);
}
```
### [/nearsound/near-contracts/nft-contract/enumeration.rs](https://github.com/pythonicode/nearsound/blob/main/near-contracts/nft-contract/src/enumeration.rs)

```rust
pub fn nft_tokens_for_search(&self, search_term: SearchTerm, from_index: Option<U128>, limit: Option<u64>) -> Vec<JsonToken> {

        let tokens_for_search = self.tokens_per_search.get(&search_term); // Get the set of tokens for the search term
        let tokens = if let Some(tokens_for_search) = tokens_for_search { // If there is tokens, we'll set the tokens variable
            tokens_for_search
        } else {
            // If there is no tokens, we'll simply return an empty vector. 
            return vec![];
        };
        let keys = tokens.as_vector(); // Convert the UnorderedSet into a vector of strings
        let start = u128::from(from_index.unwrap_or(U128(0))); // Where to start pagination
        keys.iter().skip(start as usize).take(limit.unwrap_or(0) as usize).map(|token_id| self.nft_token(token_id.clone()).unwrap()).collect()
    }
```

Above are only some of the features of the smart contract I currently have deployed at `nearsound.testnet` which acts as the provider for testnet.nearsound.org

## Challenges

Almost everything about this project was challenging! I had to...

1) Learn how to _code in Rust_

2) Learn how to _write NEAR smart contracts_

3) Learn how to _use Next JS_ for the front-end application

AND I had to put all of that together to create a final, working product.

The biggest technical challenge of the project was creating the __custom player component__ from scratch. It implements the logic that allows you to play, queue, skip, and shuffle songs from the dashboard and there are still a few kinks I have to work out.

The biggest challenge with the smart contract was modifying the contract to allow the enumeration of tokens by a given search term.

## Accomplishments

I'm proud to have started with no experience in Rust or coding NEAR smart contracts to having deployed a live application on the testnet within the span of just over 1 month!

## What's Next

This is the most exciting part! I have so much more I want to do with Nearsound, this was just the beginning. I could only do so much within 1 month so there's a lot more coming.

Here's a little roadmap of what I have planned.

1) Recreate the front-end in Svelte Kit while working out bugs and modifying the UI making it more compatible and responsive for all kinds of devices.

2) Add new features to the smart contract for tracking song plays/interactions to better display songs on the main page of the application.

3) Perhaps include a decentralized advertising ecosystem (not sure about this one)

4) Update the front-end to allow querying pages for individual artists/songs.

5) Create a marketplace contract where users can buy/sell and trade their music.

6) Deploy everything to the mainnet! 

Thanks! I hope you enjoyed my project. -Anthony
